prenton-caslon-musings
======================

This article on [Prenton] had some nice pairings that I wanted to explore. Prenton/Caslon really grabbed
me so I went ahead and styled some Austen and threw it in a doc. Pretty basic stuff, although I'm sure
the ratio of my font-sizes is completely off.
